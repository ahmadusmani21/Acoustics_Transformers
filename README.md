This project implements DeepONet and Transformers for acoustic wave propagation modeling. Originally based on DeepONet, we explore using Transformers to model wave propagation as a sequence prediction task. The dataset consists of wave simulations generated using Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (DG-FEM) for 1D, 2D, and 3D wave propagation. We implement a WaveTransformer model that encodes wave parameters and predicts propagation patterns. Training and evaluation scripts are included, making it adaptable for real-world acoustic applications.
